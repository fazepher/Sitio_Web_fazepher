I was invited to comment a paper as part of WDSS' Papers and Code Club. We discussed *Variational Learning on Aggregate Outputs with Gaussian Process* by Law, Sejdinovic et al (2018). The paper and appendices can be found [here](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2018/hash/24b43fb034a10d78bec71274033b4096-Abstract.html) and it has its own [Github repository](https://github.com/hcllaw/VBAgg).

These are the slides:

They can be seen in full screen  [here](https://fazepher.github.io/VBAgg-Pres-WDSS/VBagg_Reading_WDSS.html#1)
