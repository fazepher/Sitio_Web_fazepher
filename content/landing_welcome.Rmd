I'm Fernando, a Mexican statistician and data scientist passionate about social and political applications. Starting this fall, I will be at the University of Warwick studying the MSc in Statistics. I usually work with `r htmltools::HTML("{{% icons r-project %}}")`, Shiny and Stan. Here, I'll share with you some of my projects and posts on Bayesian statistics, applied data science, polling, politics, sports and history of statistics. Please, do get in touch at `fazepher@gmail.com` or on social media.
