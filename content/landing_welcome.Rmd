I'm Fernando, a Mexican statistician and data scientist passionate about social and political applications. I am currently at the University of Warwick studying the MPhil/PhD in Statistics. I usually work with `r htmltools::HTML("{{% icons r-project %}}")`, Shiny and Stan. Here, I'll share with you some of my projects and posts on Bayesian statistics, applied data science, polling, politics, sports and history of statistics. You should expect content in English and in Spanish.

Please, do get in touch at `Fernando.Zepeda@warwick.ac.uk` or on social media.
