<p>I’m Fernando, a Mexican statistician and data scientist passionate about social and political applications. Starting this fall, I will be at the University of Warwick studying the MSc in Statistics.</p>
<p>Previously, I worked at ThinkData MX, a statistical and public opinion consulting firm based in Mexico City. I hold a BSc in Actuarial Science and a BA in International Relations, both from ITAM, and my dissertation was on multilevel binomial regressions on French electoral data, fitted through Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. I’ve been a Probability Teacher Assistant at UNAM’s Science Faculty and an editor of <em>Laberintos e Infinitos</em>, one of ITAM’s students magazines.</p>
<p>You should expect posts on Bayesian statistics, applied data science, polling, politics, sports and some history of statistics. I usually work with R and Stan. Don’t hesitate in getting in touch with me through Twitter or Github.</p>
